# SnowGame

A simple minigame for Terraria TShock.

## Game mechanics and how it works.

SnowGame is incredibly simple:
  - There are two teams that fight with each other
  - When one member of a team kills their oponent, the killer's team obtains 10 score points.
  - The team with the most score points at the end of the 5 minute mark wins.



## Building.

To build the project, all you have to do is clone the source code, add the bare references found [here](https://tshock.readme.io/docs/hello-world#dont-forget-to-reference).  
Then simply build the project and copy the generated SnowGame.dll into your ServerPlugins folder.
